# LoLify
Solo project to create a Spotify playlist with music tailored to a user's League of Legends (LoL) performance.

Music is curated by adjusting [tunable track attributes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-recommendations#tuneable-track-attributes) when getting [seeded song recommendations](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/browse/get-recommendations/) based on LoL account stats from [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/Riot)
